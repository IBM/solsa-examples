# SolSA Examples

This folder contains sample SolSA solutions that illustrate different use cases.
* [Bookinfo](bookinfo) shows how an existing microservice based application is
  expressed in SolSA as an application pattern and how SolSA simplifies the
  reuse of that pattern in an enhanced application.
* [Translator](translator) focuses on configuring a single newly-developed
  microservice that relies on an IBM Cloud Service for its core functionality.
* [Knative Eventing](knative-eventing) shows how SolSA can simplify the
  specification of a Knative eventing pattern that connects a Kafka event source
  to a Knative service sink.
* [K-Container](k-container) shows how SolSA can be used to capture an
  event-driven architecture pattern from the IBM Cloud Garage.
