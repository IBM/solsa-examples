# SolSA in Action: Knative Eventing

This example combines many of SolSA's capabilities in one solution. It use a
managed Event Streams service on the IBM Cloud to connect a Kubernetes service
producing messages to a Knative service consuming these messages. This example
deploys two microservices using a prebuild, public container image for one of
the microservice and building the image for the other microservice from scratch.

This example solution combines three tutorial examples in one: [Event
Streams](../../tutorial#example-event-streams), [Event Streams
Producer](../../tutorial#example-event-streams-producer), and [Event Streams
Consumer](../../tutorial#example-event-streams-consumer).

## Description

The solution code in [example.js](example.js) is:
```javascript
const path = require('path')
const solsa = require('solsa')
const bundle = new solsa.Bundle()
module.exports = bundle

// Event Streams instance
bundle.kafka = new solsa.EventStreams({ name: 'kafka', plan: 'standard', serviceClassType: 'CF' })

// Event Streams Topic
bundle.topic = new bundle.kafka.Topic({ name: 'topic', topicName: 'MyTopic' })

// Producer (containerized service) interfacing directly with Event Streams
bundle.producer = new solsa.ContainerizedService({ name: 'producer', image: 'kafka-producer', build: path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'tutorial', 'kafka-producer') })
bundle.producer.env = {
  BROKERS: bundle.kafka.getSecret('kafka_brokers_sasl'),
  USER: bundle.kafka.getSecret('user'),
  PASSWORD: bundle.kafka.getSecret('password'),
  TOPIC: bundle.topic.topicName
}

// Consumer (Knative service)
bundle.sink = new solsa.KnativeService({ name: 'sink', image: 'gcr.io/knative-releases/github.com/knative/eventing-sources/cmd/event_display' })

// Knative event source to connect the topic to the consumer
bundle.source = new bundle.topic.Source({ name: 'source', sink: bundle.sink })
```
Refer to the [tutorial](../../tutorial#example-event-streams) for detailed
explanations of the various components.

## Deployment

Build and push the container image for the producer microservice with:
```shell
solsa build example.js
solsa push example.js
```
Deploy the solution with:
```shell
solsa yaml example.js | kubectl apply -f -
```
Check, e.g.,  the consumer service logs:
```shell
kubectl logs -lserving.knative.dev/service=sink -c user-container
```
Undeploy the solution with command:
```shell
solsa yaml example.js | kubectl delete -f -
```
